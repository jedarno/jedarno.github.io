I am a PhD student at Royal Holloway, University of London and Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew.
 I have a Bsc (hons) in Computer Science and a Mcs in Machine Learning.
My research interests are computer vision and applications of Machine Learning in the Natural Sciences.
Currently I am focused on the use of machine learning in accelerated taxonomy to speed up the identication of plant species.

<b>Royal Holloway:</b> Alongside my PhD I am also teaching at Royal Holloway, as a lab assisstant. I am currently teaching cs5950: Deep Learning.  

---

<b>Kew Gardens:</b> I am working with kew Gardens as a part of my PhD to improve the efficiency of the identification of herbarium samples.
This project is part of a larger effort across the Natural Sciences to use machine learning to bridge the taxonomical gap.  

---

<b>Photography</b> I am also an amateur photographer. Mainly taking analogue photos on a Canon A1.
I find the limitations of the analogue format require a more deliberate and thoughtful approach which I enjoy.
